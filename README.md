A simple Computer Algebra System developed in Haskell.
Parsec is utilised for parsing mathematical expressions.

Current functionality include:
- Expansion and simplification of functions
- Series evaluation from start to end for a given f(n)
- Sequence generation for a given f(n)
- Taylor series expansion of nth degree around a for a given f.
- Fourier series expansion of n terms around a for a given f.
- Numerical differentiation via Finite Difference Method with a given epsilon precision.
- Numerical Integration via Simpson's rule for a given interval size d and epsilon precision.
- Root finding via Newton-Rhapson method with a given epsilon precision.

A cabal file is included for building.
